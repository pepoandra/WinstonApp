# WinstonApp

This simple application is meant to help bartenders and waiters of Sir Winston Churchill Pub Complexe to cash-out at the end of the nights.

The servers add their starting money, their total sales and the total alcohol sales as well as any credit or debit card transaction.

Then, the program calculates the total in card transactions, and based on that it calculates how much money should be deposited to complete the cash.



### Future features to be added: 
-Scan credit card slips with the camera  
-Calculate average sales & tips based on past nights.
